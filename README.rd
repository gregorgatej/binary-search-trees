# Binary Search Trees

his project provides a Ruby implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the following features:

- Node and Tree classes for BST structure and operations
- Methods for insertion, deletion, and search
- Traversal methods: level-order, preorder, inorder, and postorder (with optional block support)
- Utility methods: height, depth, balance check, and tree rebalancing

The tree is initialized from a sorted, unique array.

This repository is built in the context of The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-binary-search-trees
